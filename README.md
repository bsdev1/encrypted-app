# LockGuard App - Share Encrypted Messages and Files in Real-Time! üì®üîíüìÇ

LockGuard is a user-friendly app that lets you securely share encrypted messages and files in real-time. Built with Socket.IO, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript, it prioritizes your privacy and keeps your sensitive information protected. Say goodbye to intercepted conversations and data breaches.

## Features ‚ú®üöÄ

- **Real-time Communication**: Experience instant and synchronized communication between devices, allowing you to share messages and files effortlessly.

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Your data is shielded with the highest level of security using AES256 encryption. Feel confident that only you can access your content.

- **Auto Message Destruction**: Enjoy the convenience of setting a self-destruct timer for your messages. After a specified time, your messages automatically vanish, leaving no trace behind.

- **Export Messages**: Capture important conversations by exporting them to your local storage. You can conveniently access and refer to these conversations whenever necessary.
